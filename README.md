# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Neural-Network
DCGAN works with two neural networks: a generator creates fake images, and a discriminator evaluates them against real images. The generator learns to produce increasingly realistic images, while the discriminator improves at distinguishing real from fake. They train adversarially, enhancing each other's performance.
